I've created a basic structure for your Mama Joyce Handbag Management App using React and some components from the shadcn/ui library. Here's an explanation of the key features:

Overall Layout:

The app has a main title and a tab-based interface for easy navigation between different sections.
We're using the Tabs component from shadcn/ui for a clean, modern look.


Inventory Management:

The inventory tab displays product cards with images, names, sellers, prices, and quantities.
There's a button to add new products (functionality to be implemented).


Other Sections:

Placeholders for Suppliers, Customers, Sales, and Alerts tabs are included.
These sections can be expanded with more detailed functionality as needed.


Product Images:

The ProductCard component includes an image slot. Currently, it uses a placeholder, but this can be replaced with actual product images.


Supplier and Customer Information:

The structure is in place to add detailed supplier and customer information in their respective tabs.


Visual Design:

The design uses a clean, modern aesthetic with a responsive layout.
Icons from the lucide-react library are used to enhance visual appeal and improve usability.



To fully implement all the features you've requested, we'll need to:

Add forms for inputting new products, suppliers, and customers.
Implement image upload functionality for product photos.
Create a sales tracking system with profit/loss calculations.
Develop a reorder alert system based on inventory levels.
Add the ability to hide original prices for products.

Would you like me to focus on implementing any specific feature next? Or would you prefer to see a more detailed mockup of one of the other tabs?



UPDATE

I've updated the Mama Joyce Handbag Management App to include the shareable inventory feature you requested. Here are the key additions and changes:

New "Share" Tab:

Added a new tab in the main navigation for sharing functionality.
This tab allows you to generate a shareable link for your product catalog.


Public Catalog View:

Created a new PublicCatalog component that displays a customer-friendly view of your products.
This view only shows product images, names, prices, and descriptions - it doesn't include sensitive information like supplier names or inventory quantities.


Shareable Link Generation:

Added a button to generate a shareable link (note: in a real application, this would create a unique, secure URL).
The generated link is displayed and can be easily copied by customers.


Preview Functionality:

Added a "Preview Public Catalog" button that lets you see how your catalog will appear to customers.


Product Description:

Added a description field to the product data, which is visible in both the admin and public views.



Here's how you can use this new feature:

Click on the "Share" tab in your admin panel.
Click "Generate Shareable Link" to create a link for your public catalog.
Copy this link and share it with your customers.
Use the "Preview Public Catalog" button to see how your catalog looks to customers.

In the public view, customers will see a clean, professional display of your products with images, names, prices, and descriptions, but without any sensitive business information.
To further enhance this feature, we could add:

The ability to select which products to include in the public catalog.
Custom theming options for the public catalog to match your brand.
Contact forms or buttons in the public catalog for customers to inquire about products.

Would you like me to implement any of these additional features, or do you have any other ideas to improve the shareable catalog?
